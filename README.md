This is set up to work as a VM. Duplicating it would be hard.
I’m linking several Wallets to an accounting package. I don’t want any link to Monero in the accounting package. I need a cli-wallet csv export with these fields.   
Required Fields :
Date, Time, Direction, Address Label, Address Book Label, Amount, Fee.
Required for Multi Wallet :
Wallet Name.

The code works.
